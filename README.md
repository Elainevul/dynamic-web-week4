2.Install Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js, using the command npm install express.

3.Create a server.js file where you'll write a server-side code.
Within server.js, require the Express module and create an instance of the Express application.
Define meaningful API routes using Express's routing methods such as app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), and app.delete().
Utilize middleware like express.json() to parse incoming request bodies as JSON.

5.Load data from a JSON file or interact with an external API as needed.

6.Create an index.html file in a public directory to serve as the main entry point for my client-side code.
Write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code within index.html and associated files in the public directory to create the client-side interface.
